This is a latex notetaker software developed by me, Grant DeWaay, Gavin Tersteeg, and Nikhil Kuricheti. 

To access the notetaker, go to index.html under the frontend folder.

Note that while this use to be connected to a server, and thus the login and signup server were working, the server is no longer available so the login and signup screen are not fully working.
